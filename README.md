## Facial Keypoint Detection
 
# Project Overview
In this project, I combined my knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints included points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. This code can look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face; examples of these keypoints are displayed below.
